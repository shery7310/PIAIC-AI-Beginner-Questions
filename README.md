### **Basic Operations**

1. Create a dictionary `student` with keys: `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Assign them appropriate values.
2. Access the value of the key `grade` in the `student` dictionary.
3. Add a new key `city` to the `student` dictionary and set its value to `"New York"`.
4. Update the value of the `age` key in the `student` dictionary to `20`.

### **Advanced Dictionary Usage**

11. Merge the following two dictionaries and print the result:
  
  ```python
  dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}  
  dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}

14. Reverse the dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}` so that keys become values and values become keys.
15. Write a Python function to check if two dictionaries are identical (contain the same key-value pairs).

### **Nested Dictionaries**
- Create a nested dictionary to represent the following data:
  
  ```
  Person:

    Age: 30  
    Address:  
      Street: 123 Elm St  
      City: Boston  
  ```

18. Delete the `Address` key from the nested dictionary.
19. Iterate through all the keys in the outermost level of the nested dictionary and print them.

22. Create a dictionary to map numbers 1 to 5 to their squares (e.g., `{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, ...}`).
23. Write a Python program to remove duplicate values from the dictionary `{'a': 10, 'b': 15, 'c': 10, 'd': 15}`.
24. Write a Python function that accepts a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key. If the key doesn’t exist, return `"Key not found"`.

---

### **Challenging Problems**

25. Given two dictionaries `dict1 = {'a': 5, 'b': 10}` and `dict2 = {'a': 3, 'b': 7}`, write a Python program to add the values of matching keys and print the result.

26. Write a Python program to create a dictionary where the keys are the first `n` positive integers, and the values are their cubes. Take `n` as user input.

27. Flatten the following nested dictionary into a single-level dictionary:
  
  ```python
  {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}, 'd': {'e': 3, 'f': 4}}  
  ```

28. Write a Python program to split a dictionary into two based on whether the values are odd or even.

29. Create a dictionary comprehension to filter out all keys in `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}` where the value is less than 3.
